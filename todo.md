# Our project agenda as of now
* Add consistent `data` prefixes
* decide upon a clear approach regarding verification. (see subsections)
  * Right now, we move it upfront, which leads to numerous advantages. 
  * However, this also urges the usage of ugly things like `head` and
    `fromJust`
  * look into how we want to handle discrepancy between the types as expected
    in `Main.hs` and how they are (partly) implemented in the modules. (same)
    * This is especially important considering the fact that the current
      `master`-version makes the API functions return a `IO (ApiResponse a)`,
      while most of those just wrap whatever they return into a call to
      `success`, which is definitely a bad sign.
* add merging and other useful features that are still needed

## Thoughts on verification
We can keep it "up front" and make it return the data needed for whatever
calculation we do
* For instance, if we verify a signup by `Credentials`, we check whether it
  is valid (a user exists) and return said user. This scales well with the
  `Either` type which we used anyway.
* This is simple, and makes it possible to encode some guarantees about our
  data into it's types, avoiding the usage of unsafe functions.
* To summarize, we have a new layering concept now: A request gets passed
  to a layer verifying it's integrity, and optionally returning data.

### Realization of above draft
We define `ApiRequest` as a typeclass that defines a
`runVer :: r -> IO (ApiResponse t)` with a functional dependency
from `r` to `t`. That way, we can rewrite our generic wrappers in main
to make full use of the `Either`-monad and abandon `verify` altogether.
Now, we can also "throw" (purely return) errors from our application code
because this gets handled appropriately by `>>=`. The decision about whether
to return `ApiResponses` from API functions or not is easily solvable
considering individual cases, but should be handled in a consistent manner,
so this is likely to happen.

## Conclusion
* learn about functional dependencies
* decide on additional types to represent information passed to
  computation functions. However, this might be unnecessary in some cases,
  since a lot can be done via a simple pattern: `storeStuff (somePureFunc â€¦)`
